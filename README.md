This repo contains the frontend for [Korp](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/korp), a frontend for the IMS Open Corpus Workbench (CWB). The korp frontend is a great tool for searching and
and visualising natural language corpus data. 

Korp is developed by [Spr√•kbanken](https://spraakbanken.gu.se) at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

# sass

To compile the sass-stylesheets, Ruby and sass is required. Install Ruby and then `gem install sass`

## npm

To install all Grunt-dependencies needed run `npm install`

## bower

All dependencies that are needed are under version control (`app/components`). To add a new dependency run:
`bower install --save-dev <package_name>`

## grunt

Available target in grunt are:
- clean - Remove all built files
- test - Run tests. The graphical user tests are dependent on SUC 2.0, SUC 3.0 and a parallel mode with some corpora available in the tested instance. Run `node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update` to install drivers.
- build - Same as running only `grunt`. Creates a dist-folder with only built files, css and js are concatenated and minfied. html are also minified.
- serve - Start a local instance of Korp. Also builds any necessary files.
- release - Same as build, but updates a file with SVN revision

## Local setup for Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
sudo apt-get install nodejs
npm install
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
sudo gem install sass
grunt serve

## Known bugs

Korp has a number of known bugs. Most are GUI bugs, but some are more serious. They will be fixed!

- Issues with linking to Korp and internal links. Opening a link to Korp in a tab where Korp is already open often leads to errors. For example selected corpora will not change.
- Issues with the progress bars in the tabs. Sometimes tabs will show progress of another tab.
- A bug in CWB that makes CQP-expressions searching for first a token ending with " and then another token fail. Example: [word = "\""] [word = "och"].

Please send any issues to sb-korp@svenska.gu.se
