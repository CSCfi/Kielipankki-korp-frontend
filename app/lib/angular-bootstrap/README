Warning! This is a modified version of ui-boostrap.

The change can be found in the directive 'dropdown'.

The default behavior is that the dropdown will close on the
event "locationChangeSuccess". This is found in the
DropdownController on line 2184.

The modification is that the event handler for
locationChangeSuccess has been commented out and the reason
is that "Compile based on"-dropdown actually changes the
location bar to persist the choices and thus always closes
after the user selects an attribute.

It is possible that this will be changed in future versions
of ui-bootstrap.
