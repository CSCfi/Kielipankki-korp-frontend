<!-- Trend diagram zoom and place name map 2016-01-25 -->

This Korp Labs (or “Korp beta”) now has in test use a new version of
Korp with two significant new features:

* **Zooming the trend diagram** down to the level of days in corpora
  with date information at the granularity of days.

* **A map** showing places (towns, municipalities, villages) whose
  names occur in the search result. Korp interprets as place names all
  proper names found in a place-name gazetteer even if they were
  person names in the text. The map currently shows places only in
  Finland and Sweden.

In addition, some bugs have been fixed.


<!-- Name classification and restricting search context 2015-08-28 -->

This Korp beta installation (or “Korp Labs”) now has two new features
for testing:

* **Name classification results** show the 30 most common person,
  place, organization and other names which occur in the *texts*
  (documents) containing search hits. Name classification currently
  only works for the FinnTreeBank 3 and Suomi24 corpora. The names
  have been extracted and classified automatically.

* **Restricting the search context**: In the simple search you can
  restrict the main search to the sentences, paragraphs or texts that
  contain given words in any order. The restricting words may be
  lemmas or word forms. Words between double quotation marks
  (`"`&hellip;`"`) must occur consecutively in the text, and an
  asterisk `*` within quotation marks matches any single word. The
  KWIC view highlights only the hits for the main search expression.
  Restricting the search context does not currently affect the name
  classification results.


<!-- The main Korp installation updated to the new version 2015-04-30 -->

[The main Korp installation](https://korp.csc.fi/) has now been
updated to the new version 4.0. This Korp beta installation
([https://korp.csc.fi/beta/](https://korp.csc.fi/beta/)) continues to
serve as a testing platform for new Korp features and bug fixes.


<!-- The new Korp in final testing 2015-04-17 -->

This new Korp version finally has all the features of the previous
version, and the [main Korp installation](https://korp.csc.fi/) will soon
be updated to the new version.

However, the word picture currently works only for a handful of
corpora. Updating all corpora to the new version will take a couple of
weeks.

If a feature that worked in the previous version does not seem to work
any more, please contact us via the [Korp feedback form](https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/56593/lomake.html?rinnakkaislomake=korpfeedback).


<!-- New version of Korp in beta testing 2015-02-10 -->

New features of the new Korp include this **news feature** and
comparing two search results.

Some features of the [old Korp](https://korp.csc.fi/) do not yet work:
e.g., downloading search results, word picture and corpus information
links.

The new Korp will replace the old version once all features of the old
one have been transferred to the new one.
