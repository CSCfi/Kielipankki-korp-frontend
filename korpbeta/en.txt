<!-- The main Korp installation updated to the new version 2015-04-30 -->

[The main Korp installation](https://korp.csc.fi/) has now been
updated to the new version 4.0. This Korp beta installation
([https://korp.csc.fi/beta/](https://korp.csc.fi/beta/)) continues to
serve as a testing platform for new Korp features and bug fixes.

<!-- The new Korp in final testing 2015-04-17 -->

This new Korp version finally has all the features of the previous
version, and the [main Korp installation](https://korp.csc.fi/) will soon
be updated to the new version.

However, the word picture currently works only for a handful of
corpora. Updating all corpora to the new version will take a couple of
weeks.

If a feature that worked in the previous version does not seem to work
any more, please contact us via the [Korp feedback form](https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/56593/lomake.html?rinnakkaislomake=korpfeedback).

<!-- New version of Korp in beta testing 2015-02-10 -->

New features of the new Korp include this **news feature** and
comparing two search results.

Some features of the [old Korp](https://korp.csc.fi/) do not yet work:
e.g., downloading search results, word picture and corpus information
links.

The new Korp will replace the old version once all features of the old
one have been transferred to the new one.
