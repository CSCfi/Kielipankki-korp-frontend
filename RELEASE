Release manual

These are some guidelines how to release Korp to "labb" or production.

Begin with:
* Make sure that all changed are commited to SVN
* Run all tests (currently unstable, will be fixed):
  > node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update (if you have not already installed webdrivers)
  > grunt test

Labb:
* Build a release using
  > grunt release:labb
  For this to work, the repository must be checkout by svn and not git-svn. The reason 
  is that we create a file with the SVN revision number for tracking. (dist/release-info).
  (It is still possible to build the dist-folder using just "grunt")
* Do basic testing locally on the built version
  > grunt serve:dist
* Update the server with the new dist folder:
  > rsync --delete -r dist/ fkkorp@k2.spraakdata.gu.se:/var/www/html_sb/korplabb

Production:

  For major changes:
    - We should release in the beginning of the week
    - The release should first be tested in the labb-environment, preferably by several people
    - Bump the version number in packages.json and app/markup/about.html, commit the changes
    - Create a branch and switch to working on there for fixes in the release

  Build a release using SVN (creates a release-info file):
    > grunt release

  Build a release using git-svn (not recommended, because SVN revision is not available)

  Test the release
    > grunt serve:dist

  Push release to server
    > rsync --delete -r dist/ fkkorp@k2.spraakdata.gu.se:/var/www/html_sb/korp

  Upload archive for download on webpage
    - Remove the dist folder and zip the other content of the repository (ignore .svn-folders)
    - Upload as https://svn.spraakdata.gu.se/repos/lb/trunk/sbkhs/pub/korp_frontend.zip on SVN

  Update git-repository
    - TODO
