Korp’s database will be updated on 22 November 2022 between 8 am and

that the extension is in beta testing, so it may be changed without
notice.


<!-- Major Korp update 2022-02-14 -->

Korp has been updated to version 9. In addition to bug fixes, the new
Korp has some new features, although some of them will be activated
only when the required support for them has been added to corpora

For the time being, the new Korp also lacks some features of the old
Korp, but they will be added gradually. **Please report any bugs and
deficiencies** in the new Korp (and also wishes) either via <a
href="https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/56593/lomake.html?rinnakkaislomake=korpfeedback"
target="_blank">feedback form</a> or by email to `fin-clarin (at)
helsinki.fi`.

**The old Korp version** will remain available for the time being at **<a
href="https://korp.csc.fi/korp-old/#?lang=en"
target="_blank">https://korp.csc.fi/korp-old/#?lang=en</a>**.

**Changes and new features:**

* In the corpus selector, corpora have been grouped by their “resource
  family”, a rough type of text.
* No corpus is selected by default.
* Several corpora have more attributes whose value can be selected
  from a selection list in the extended search, often using
  autocompletion.
* Some corpora support filtering the search by the values of some text
  attributes also in the simple search.
* The corpus selection and other search parameters are retained when
  switching from one mode to another and back, for example, _Finnish_
  → _Other languages_ → _Finnish_.
* The map feature has been improved. It is at present active only in
  Finnish dialect corpora, for which the map shows hits by the parish.
  The map is activated from the statistics result tab.
* The Korp API is available at <a
href="https://korp.csc.fi/korp/api8/"
target="_blank">https://korp.csc.fi/korp/api8/</a>, and it has some
  changes compared with the old one.

**Known deficiencies:**

* The old map feature, which was based on names occurring in text, no
  longer works, but we intend to add to corpora information which
  would allow a similar result in the new Korp.
* If a Korp URL refers to restricted corpora requiring login and the
  user is not logged in, the restricted corpora might not be selected
  even after login. This also depends on the browser: Chrome may work
  better than Firefox.
* When you try to choose a restricted corpus in the corpus selector,
  no popup window with a login link is opened.
* If the login has expired and you try to search from restricted
  corpora, Korp does not show a popup with a login link but only a
  generic error message.
* In the simple search, you cannot search in selected structures
  containing given word forms or base forms.
* In the advanced search, you cannot choose the structure within which
  to search.
* The selection list for the KWIC result download is more primitive.
* The error message has no details about the error.
* Some corpus-specific special features do not work. This is true at
  least for the Finnish Dialect Syntax Archive and ScotsCorr.

The aim of the update is in part to make it easier and faster to take
into use new features and bug fixes implemented for Korp at
Språkbanken also in the Korp of the Language Bank of Finland.


<!-- Korp upgrade on 14 February 2022 2022-02-02 -->

The word picture feature works now for all dependency-parsed Finnish
corpora, in particular also for _Suomi24 2001–2017_. Due to a
technical error, the word picture could previously be obtained only
for some dependency-parsed corpora. We apologize for the error and
thank the user who reported it.

However, word pictures from the _Newspaper and Periodical Corpus of
the National Library of Finland (KLK)_ are incomplete. We apologize for
the situation and try to correct it.

Please also note that the word picture works only in the simple
search, when the search word is a single word form or has been chosen
from the autocompletion list of combinations of lemmas and parts of
speech.

The subcorpora containing the abstracts (ethesis_en_dissabs and ethesis_en_maabs) have not been changed.


<!-- LAT service shut down, so links to LAT do not work 2020-12-21 -->

The LAT service for audio and video corpora had to be shut down in
December 2020 because the system became technically out-of-date. For
this reason, the download and listening links that led to LAT from the
Korp corpora *Lauseopin arkiston murrekorpus*, *SKN – Suomen kielen
näytteitä* and *Reitti A-siipeen* do not currently work.

We will fix the download links in January 2021, and we aim at
restoring the possibility to listen to search hits when Korp is
upgraded to a more recent version in spring 2021. If you have a more
urgent need for the audio data of the above-mentioned corpora, please
contact `fin-clarin (at) helsinki.fi`.

We apologize for the inconvenience caused by shutting down the LAT
service.


<!-- Korp was moved to another server on 10 December 2020 2020-12-10 -->

For technical reasons, the Korp service was moved to another server on
10 December 2020. The address of the Korp service will stay <a
href="https://korp.csc.fi#?lang=en"
target="_blank">https://korp.csc.fi</a> for the present.

In general, the Korp service should work on the new server in the same
way as on the old one. However, it has a couple of known problems:

* The word picture feature will work only for some corpora for several
  weeks.
* After logging out, you may need to return to the Korp page manually.
* The new server is slower than the old one at least at first.

**Please report any other problems and errors you notice**, either via
the <a
href="https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/56593/lomake.html?rinnakkaislomake=korpfeedback"
target="_blank">feedback form</a> or by email to `fin-clarin (at)

Moving Korp to a new server is an intermediate step in upgrading Korp
to a more recent version in spring 2021. We will inform you about that
in more detail later.

We apologize for the temporary degradation of the Korp service.


<!-- Korp to be moved to another server on 10 December 2020 2020-12-07 2020-12-09 -->

The address of the Korp service will stay <a
href="https://korp.csc.fi#?lang=en"
target="_blank">https://korp.csc.fi</a> for the present.

The change of server does not cause a service break, and in general,
the Korp service should work on the new server in the same way as
previously. However, the word picture feature will work only for some
corpora for several weeks. The new server will also be slower than the
current one at least at first.

later.

We apologize for the temporary degradation of the Korp service.


<!-- Service break and temporary degradation of service early in December 2020 2020-11-30 2020-12-06 -->

For technical reasons, the Korp service will be moved to another
server **early in December 2020**. The Korp service will have a
**service break of probably at most one day** at short notice. We will
try to keep the break as short as possible, and we will inform you
about it when its exact date is known.

On the new server, Korp’s word picture feature will work only for some
corpora for several weeks. At first, the new server will probably be
slower than the current server. It is also possible that corpora
requiring personal access rights will not be in use immediately, but
if that happens, we will try to make them available as soon as
possible.

The address of the Korp service will stay <a
href="https://korp.csc.fi#?lang=en"

Moving Korp to a new server is an intermediate step in upgrading Korp

temporary degradation of the Korp service.

folder *Selkokieli* (Easy-to-read Finnish), which makes it easier to
choose all easy-to-read Finnish corpora.

**Note** that *Leija* and *Selkosanomat/<wbr/>Selkouutiset* are still
parts of the *Corpus of Finnish Magazines and Newspapers from the
1990s and 2000s* (*1990- ja 2000-luvun suomalaisia aikakaus- ja

shown in the corpus chooser title bar counts them twice, but search
results from them are shown only once.

href="http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2020021803" target="_blank"
title="META-SHARE article">Korp version 1.1</a>, in which writer
nickname information has been corrected. The following modifications
have been made to the corpus:

* All messages have the writer nickname information also in the years
  2009–2012 and 2014, in which a large number of messages were
  previously completely missing a writer nickname.
* Writer nicknames now contain the characters *'*, *"* and *&*
  literally instead of *&amp;apos;*, *&amp;quot;* and *&amp;amp;*.
  (Search results may have shown these characters correctly, but they
  could not be searched for.)
* In the name of the corpus, *2017H2* has been replaced with the year
  range *2001–2017*, which indicates the extent of the corpus more
  clearly. The full name of the corrected version of the corpus is
  *The Suomi24 Sentences Corpus 2001–2017, Korp version 1.1*, and it
  has a new persistent identifier: <a
  href="http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2020021803" target="_blank"
  title="META-SHARE article">urn:nbn:fi:lb-2020021803</a>.

The deficient writer nickname information of the previous corpus
version is available in the Korp advanced search and Korp API as the
attribute `text_author_v1`, but it is not shown in the sidebar and you
cannot calculate statistics based on it. If you need to reproduce
searches or results based on the writer nickname of the previous
corpus version, please ask by email: `fin-clarin (at) helsinki.fi`.

The corpus *Yle Swedish News Archive (Yle svenska webbartiklar)
2012–2018, Korp* is now available in Korp for beta testing as two
variants with the same sentences but with different availability and
features:

* *the variant available for academic users logged in to Korp* (<a

The <a href="http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2019101621" target="_blank"
title="META-SHARE article"> Plenary Sessions of the Parliament of
Finland (Eduskunnan täysistunnot)</a> corpus has been updated to
version 1.5 with links to the original video recordings from (almost)
all KWIC search results (link at the bottom of the sidebar). The
recordings are streamed from the video service of the Parliament of
Finland. The beginning and end times of utterances are based on an
alignment made by an automatic speech recognizer.

**Please note** that the text shown in Korp has errors due to the
automatic speech recognition. However, the results also have links to
the original transcriptions of the Parliament of Finland.

<!-- New corpus: Kalle Päätalo’s Iijoki series 2019-11-08 -->

The corpus <a href="http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2019102101"
target="_blank">Iijoki, the University of Oulu Päätalo collection,
Kielipankki Korp version</a> is now available for researchers in Korp.
The corpus consists of the 26 volumes of Kalle Päätalo’s
autobiographical Iijoki series. The licence of the Iijoki corpus is <a
href="http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2019102106" target="_blank">CLARIN
ACA +NC +DEP 1.0</a>, so using the corpus requires an active
membership of an academic institution and logging in to Korp.

Iijoki is the first corpus in Korp parsed with the <a
href="http://turkunlp.org/Turku-neural-parser-pipeline/"
target="_blank">Turku Neural Parser Pipeline (TNPP) parser</a>.
**Please note** that the corpus contains dialect words, for whose
lemmatization automatic parsing methods have no reliable means.

<!-- Discrepancies in dependency parses: Suomi24 2017H2, Semfinlex 2019-09-02 -->

The dependency parses and relations in the Finnish Suomi24 2017H2 and
Semfinlex corpora added to Korp in spring 2019 differ significantly
from the parses in other corpora parsed earlier with the same parser.
We are investigating the issue. **If you need dependency parse
information, we recommend using other corpora than Suomi24 2017H2 and
Semfinlex for the time being.** We apologize for the situation.


<!-- New corpus (beta): Helsinki Corpus 2019-06-14b -->

The <a href="http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2017083001"
target="_blank">Helsinki Corpus TEI XML Edition (2011), Korp
Version</a> is now available in Korp as a beta test version. The
Helsinki Corpus is a diachronic corpus of Old, Middle and Early Modern
English. Using the corpus in Korp requires an active membership of an
academic institution and logging in to Korp.


<!-- Updated corpus: Oracc (Korp Version, 2019-05) 2019-06-14a -->

The <a href="http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2019060602"
target="_blank">Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc)</a>
collection has been updated with new subcorpora, more annotations and
attribute value selection lists in Korp’s extended search. This
version of Oracc in Korp contains almost all the data that were
available on the <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/index.html"
target="_blank">Oracc project website</a> in May 2019. The data have

<!-- The beta test stage of Suomi 2017H2 has ended, and changes in the names of Suomi24 corpora 2019-06-12b -->

The beta test stage of Suomi24 version 2017H2 has finally officially
ended. The corpus was not changed during the beta test stage, so
results obtained from the corpus during the beta stage are
reproducible.

The version 2017H2 of the Suomi24 corpus is now named *Suomi24 2017H2*
in Korp (previously *Suomi24 virkkeet -korpus (2017H2)*) and
the older version 2016H2 is *Suomi24 2016H2* (previously *Suomi24*).
In addition, the newer version Suomi24 2017H2 has been moved above the
older version in the Korp corpus chooser. The version of the corpus is
also shown in the names of the subcorpora.

**We recommend using the more comprehensive <a
href="http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2019021101" target="_blank">Suomi24
2017H2</a>**, unless you need comparability to research based on
version 2016H2, or the word picture or named entity information, which
are missing for the while.


<!-- Obsolete beta labels removed from corpora 2019-06-12a -->

A “beta” label that had been left for much longer than intended has
been removed from the following corpora: <a

<!-- Short maintenance break 2019-03-28 2019-04-03 -->

Korp will be restarted on <b>2nd of April 2019 at 9am</b> and
unavailable for about 5 minutes. We applogize for the inconvenience.


<!-- Small changes to corpus information 2019-03-20 -->

The pieces of information on a corpus shown in the corpus chooser and
the KWIC sidebar have been changed slightly:

* For a subcorpus of a larger corpus, the first piece of information
  is the name of the whole corpus (“Subcorpus of”).
* The Persistent Identifier (URN) of a corpus is shown as its own
  item. It is a link to the metadata of the corpus, so it replaces the
  “Metadata” link.
* The Persistent Identifier (URN) for the Korp location of the corpus
  is not shown, but the text “Link to corpus in Korp” itself is a
  link.


<!-- Updated corpus: Plenary Sessions of the Parliament of Finland 2019-03-14 -->

<a href="http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2017020202" target="_blank">The
Plenary Sessions of the Parliament of Finland corpus</a> has been
updated:

* The name of the corpus in the corpus chooser is [*Eduskunnan
  täysistunnot*](?mode=default#?corpus=eduskunta).
* Links to video recordings in the <a href="https://lat.csc.fi"
  target="_blank">LAT service</a> have been added. For technical
  reasons, only parts of the corpus have links.
* Speaker name, parliamentary group, speaker role and speech type have
  been extracted into separate attributes from the speaker
  information.
* The date and time of a speech are in ISO 8601 format *YYYY-MM-DD
  hh:mm:ss*.


<!-- New corpus version: Suomi24 sentences (2017H2) (beta) 2019-02-18 -->

The <a href="http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2019021101"
target="_blank">Suomi24 sentences corpus, version 2017H2</a> is now
available in Korp as a [beta test
version](?mode=default#?corpus=suomi24_2017h2&lang=en).

The corpus covers the discussions in the <a
href="https://keskustelu.suomi24.fi" target="_blank">Suomi24
discussion forum site</a> from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2017. The
corpus also contains messages missing from the previous version, but
no messages removed from the Suomi24 site nor messages in closed
discussion topics.

Differences from the previous version:

* The corpus has been divided into subcorpora by the year.
* Within each year, the messages of a discussion thread are
  contiguous, and the comments to a message follow the message
  commented on. Discussion threads are sorted by the time of the first
  message of the thread during that year.
* Text attributes have been renamed and the form of some attribute
  values differs from that in the previous version.
* The titles of discussion threads are also part of the text content,
  which allows searching from them using, e.g., lemmas. In contrast,
  the writer nicknames are not part of the text content.

Known deficiencies:

* The word picture does not yet work. We are investigating the issue.
* The corpus has no named-entity information yet, but we intend to add
  that during spring 2019.
* The lemmas of some words differ from those in the previous version.
  We intend to add alternative, more likely correct lemmas later.

target="_blank">Feedback on the corpus</a> is welcome, in particular
if a feature does not work that worked in the previous version and
that is not mentioned above.

<a href="http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2017021505" target="_blank">The
previous version of Suomi24</a> will remain in use in Korp for the
time being.

<a href="http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-20140730170">The morpho-syntactic
database of Mikael Agricola’s works</a> is now available in Korp as a
beta test version.


<!-- Searching from the FSTC and Svenska Parole corpora works again 2018-05-25 -->

Searching from the Swedish corpora FSTC and Svenska Parole works
again. Searches from these corpora had not produced any results since
the Korp update in December 2017. We apologize for that.


<!-- Minor fixes and usability improvements 2018-02-12 -->

Korp has received minor fixes and usability improvements, including
the following:

* Downloading the KWIC concordance works more reliably.
* Search works in the Finnish mode even if all publicly accessible
  corpora are selected.
* If your login has expired, Korp asks you to log in again.
* Korp shows a more detailed error message in many error situations.


<!-- Korp updated 2017-12-04b -->

Korp has been updated to a newer version that is based on
Språkbanken’s Korp version 5.0.10. New features, fixes and changes:

* You can compile the statistics by more than one attribute.
* You can choose the maximum number of rows in the word picture.
* To download the KWIC result, choose the format from selection lists
  and then press the button *Download KWIC*. You can choose the
  logical and physical format separately where appropriate; for
  example, *Annotations* as *Excel (XLS)*.
* Such extended searches now work that combine repeating *any word*
  with a *starts with*, *ends with* or *contains* condition on another
  token.
* Korp uses Kielipankki colours and font, and the Kielipankki symbol
  and logo are shown.

If a previously working feature no longer works or if you notice other
bugs, please send a bug report via the <a
href="https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/56593/lomake.html?rinnakkaislomake=korpfeedback"

<!-- The old versions of ParFin and ParRus have been removed 2017-12-04a -->

The old, deprecated versions of the ParFin and ParRus corpora have
been removed; they have been replaced with <a
href="http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2016121610" target="_blank">ParFin
2016</a> and <a href="http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-20140730173"

<!-- Dependency parses and named-entity information added to a few Finnish corpora 2017-11-30b -->

A few previously unparsed Finnish corpora have now been parsed with
the Turku Dependency Treebank parser, and their names have been
recognized with the FiNER named-entity recognizer. These corpora are:

* Aleksis Kivi (SKS)
* Gutenberg
* KFSPC (Finnish)
* Letters of Paul Sinebrychoff (Finnish)
* Finnish Proverb Collection
* Classics of Finnish Literature (except subcorpus Lehtonen)
* Topling (Finnish)


<!-- Corpora added to Korp 2017-11-30a -->

<!-- Trend diagram zoom and place name map 2016-03-18a -->

This Korp main installation now has two features that were previously
in test use in the Korp Labs:

* **Zooming the trend diagram** down to the level of days in corpora
  with date information at the granularity of days.

* **A map** showing places (towns, municipalities, villages) whose
  names occur in the search result. Korp interprets as place names all
  proper names found in a place-name gazetteer even if they were
  person names in the text.

In addition, the **Swedish mode** shows **words related** to the
search word in the simple search, based on the Swedish FrameNet
(SWE-FN).

Some bugs have also been fixed.

The <a href="/lab/#?lang=en" target="_blank">Korp Labs</a> in turn can
now compile statistics based on multiple attributes.

<!-- Name classification and restricting search context 2016-01-25b -->

This Korp main installation now has two features that were previously
in test use in the Korp Labs:

* **Name classification results** show the 30 most common person,
  place, organization and other names which occur in the *texts*
  (documents) containing search hits. Name classification currently
  only works for the corpora [FinnTreeBank
  3](?mode=default#?corpus=ftb3_europarl,ftb3_jrcacquis&lang=en) and
  [Suomi24 2001–2014 (sample)](?mode=default#?corpus=s24&lang=en). The
  names have been extracted and classified automatically.

* **Restricting the search context**: In the simple search you can
  restrict the main search to the sentences, paragraphs or texts that
  contain given words in any order. The restricting words may be
  lemmas or word forms. Words between double quotation marks
  (`"`&hellip;`"`) must occur consecutively in the text, and an
  asterisk `*` within quotation marks matches any single word. The
  KWIC view highlights only the hits for the main search expression.
  Restricting the search context does not currently affect the name
  classification results.

<!-- New corpora: Suomi24, OPUS and Finnish journals and magazines 2016-01-25a -->

The Finnish mode has for some time had the full version of the
[Suomi24 Internet discussion forum
corpus](?mode=default#?corpus=suomi24&lang=en) with over 2 billion
tokens. For technical reasons, the corpus has been split into nine
parts in Korp.

The parallel mode has for some time had parts of the [OPUS open source
parallel corpus](?mode=parallel#?corpus=opus&lang=en) (Finnish as one
language).

A recent addition is a collection of Finnish [scholarly
journals](?mode=default#?corpus=tiedelehdet&lang=en) and [other
journals and magazines](?mode=default#?corpus=muut_lehdet&lang=en)
from the 1990s and 2000s. This collection will grow in the near
future.


<!-- Korp updated: trend diagram now works with multiple words 2015-08-20 -->

The update has fixed bugs in the statistics result view; in
particular, you can now select multiple words or other features in the
statistics table for the trend diagram. These fixes were already
present in the <a href="/beta/?lang=en" target="_blank">beta version
of Korp</a>.
